                As I scanned the wondrous poetry of Walter De La Mare, “When the Rose is Faded” immediately captivated my attention by its universality and sincerity.
                The text speaks hopefully to the tragedy of loss, and can be programmed in any number of settings.
                The work was premiered at the Ithaca College Choral Composition Competition as a top-six finalist in 2016.

                Recorded by the Masters University Chorale, February 2017.<br>
                Conducted by Dr. Paul Plew.<br><br>
                “When the rose is faded,
                Memory may still dwell on
                Her beauty shadowed,
                And the sweet smell gone.

                That vanishing loveliness,
                That burdening breath,
                No bond of life hath then,
                Nor grief of death.

                'Tis the immortal thought
                Whose passion still
                Makes the changing
                The unchangeable.

                Oh, thus thy beauty,
                Loveliest on earth to me,
                Dark with no sorrow, shines
                And burns, with thee.”

                Lyrics: Anonymous (2nd Century A.D.)<br>

                The “Gloria Patri” (known as the “lesser doxology”) is a text of immense breadth and substance that
                defies its brevity. Originating anonymously in the 2nd century A.D. and fixed in liturgical form by
                the 4th century A.D., it carries the weight of antiquity and reverence. Though the text has
                traditionally been presented in short, 1-2 minute settings, I felt a more extensive treatment could
                appropriately explore its thematic scope.<br><br>

                As an acknowledgement to the clear presentation of the Trinity, the work is
                structured around three homophonic presentations of the text “Gloria Patri,
                et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto.” Between these sections lie thematic variations
                of the “Sicut erat” text, each meant to explore a different dimension of the
                unfathomable length of eternity.

                “Come, Sleep” by John Fletcher has endured the test of time beyond its original
                composition for the Jacobean-era stageplay,“The Woman Hater” (1607).
                The core, unifying theme for the text is longing, which I attempted to recreate through a
                luscious refrain of the opening words, “Come, Sleep.” Suitable for advanced choirs with an exceptional accompanist,
                the work floats dreamily through each stanza to a roaring climax in the second refrain.

                "COME, Sleep, and with thy sweet deceiving
                Lock me in delight awhile;
                Let some pleasing dreams beguile
                All my fancies; that from thence
                I may feel an influence
                All my powers of care bereaving!

                Though but a shadow, but a sliding,
                Let me know some little joy!
                We that suffer long annoy
                Are contented with a thought
                Through an idle fancy wrought:
                O let my joys have some abiding!"

                “Halleluyah!” is an advanced SATB arrangement of a work written for use in the synagogue.
                Originally presented as an ethnographic research study of Reformed Jewish cantors,
                the work won the 2016 Kol Emet Young Composer’s Prize for Jewish Music under
                adjudication by Dr. Samuel Adler. As the “punctuation mark of the Psalms,” it is
                an energetic and vibrant setting, featuring a challenging piano accompaniment.
