                As I scanned the wondrous poetry of Walter De La Mare, “When the Rose is Faded” immediately captivated my attention by its universality and sincerity.
                The text speaks hopefully to the tragedy of loss, and can be programmed in any number of settings.
                The work was premiered at the Ithaca College Choral Composition Competition as a top-six finalist in 2016.

                “When the rose is faded,
                Memory may still dwell on
                Her beauty shadowed,
                And the sweet smell gone.

                That vanishing loveliness,
                That burdening breath,
                No bond of life hath then,
                Nor grief of death.

                'Tis the immortal thought
                Whose passion still
                Makes the changing
                The unchangeable.

                Oh, thus thy beauty,
                Loveliest on earth to me,
                Dark with no sorrow, shines
                And burns, with thee.”

                Lyrics: John Fletcher<br>
                Language: English<br>
                Duration: 5:30
            </p>
            <p class="description-text">
                “Come, Sleep” by John Fletcher has endured the test of time beyond its original
                composition for the Jacobean-era stageplay,“The Woman Hater” (1607).
                The core, unifying theme for the text is longing, which I attempted to recreate through a
                luscious refrain of the opening words, “Come, Sleep.” Suitable for advanced choirs with an exceptional accompanist,
                the work floats dreamily through each stanza to a roaring climax in the second refrain.
            </p>
            <p class="description-text">
                COME, Sleep, and with thy sweet deceiving
                Lock me in delight awhile;
                Let some pleasing dreams beguile
                All my fancies; that from thence
                I may feel an influence
                All my powers of care bereaving!

                Though but a shadow, but a sliding,
                Let me know some little joy!
                We that suffer long annoy
                Are contented with a thought
                Through an idle fancy wrought:
                O let my joys have some abiding!
                -	John Fletcher (1607)
